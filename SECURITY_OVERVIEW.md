## 1. Executive Summary

AIOps Studio - Inventory is a **standalone Windows 11 desktop application** designed for non-profit food pantry inventory management. It is a fully self-contained, compiled executable with **no network connectivity, no background services, no scheduled tasks, and no elevated privilege requirements at runtime**. All data is stored locally in the current user's `%LOCALAPPDATA%` profile directory using an embedded SQLite database engine.

The application poses a **minimal attack surface** in an MSP-managed environment. It does not communicate outbound, does not listen on any port, does not install kernel drivers or Windows services, and cannot be used as a lateral movement vector. The only change it makes outside of `%LOCALAPPDATA%` is the standard Inno Setup uninstall registry key written during installation.

## 3. Process Inventory

### Processes to Whitelist

| Process | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AIOpsStudio.exe` | `%ProgramFiles%\AIOpsStudio\AIOpsStudio.exe` | Main application executable |

**Only one process is launched.** The application does **not** spawn child processes, shell out to `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `wscript.exe`, or any interpreter at runtime. The Python runtime is compiled and statically linked into the executable — there is no separate `python.exe` or `pythonw.exe` process.

> **Group Policy / AppLocker Note:** A path-based rule for `%ProgramFiles%\AIOpsStudio\AIOpsStudio.exe` or a publisher rule for `AI Ops Studio LLC` is sufficient for process whitelisting. No wildcard rules are required.

---

## 4. File System Footprint

The application reads and writes to two distinct locations only:

### 4.1 Installation Directory (Read-Only at Runtime)

```
%ProgramFiles%\AIOpsStudio\
└── AIOpsStudio.exe          ← Main executable
└── (compiled runtime libs)  ← Qt6, Python stdlib — read-only after install
```

- Written **only** during installation/uninstallation.
- Standard user install is supported (`PrivilegesRequired=lowest`). If the user has rights to install to `%ProgramFiles%`, the installer will use that path; otherwise it falls back to `%LocalAppData%\Programs\AIOpsStudio\`.
- **No writes occur here during normal application use.**

### 4.2 User Data Directory (Read/Write at Runtime)

All runtime data is scoped to the current user's profile:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\AIOpsStudio\
├── inventory.db             ← Production SQLite database
├── inventory.db-wal         ← SQLite WAL journal (normal SQLite operation)
├── inventory.db-shm         ← SQLite shared memory file (normal SQLite operation)
├── training.db              ← Training/demo SQLite database
├── crash_log.txt            ← Written only on unhandled exception
├── logs\
│   ├── aiopsstudio.log      ← Rotating application log (max 10 MB, 5 backups = 50 MB max)
│   ├── aiopsstudio.log.1
│   └── ...
├── reports\
│   ├── *.pdf                ← PDF reports generated by user on demand
│   └── *.xlsx               ← Excel reports generated by user on demand
└── backups\
    └── inventory_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.db  ← Manual/automated DB backups
```

> **DLP / File Monitoring Note:** Watch paths under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AIOpsStudio\reports\` if PDF/Excel data exfiltration is a concern. Reports contain food pantry inventory and financial cost data only — **no PII is collected or stored by this application.**

---

## 5. Network Behavior

| Category | Status |
|---|---|
| Outbound HTTP/HTTPS | ❌ None |
| DNS Lookups | ❌ None |
| Listening TCP/UDP Ports | ❌ None |
| Remote Database Connections | ❌ None |
| Cloud Storage / Sync | ❌ None |
| Auto-Update Mechanism | ❌ None |
| Telemetry / Analytics | ❌ None |
| Email / SMTP | ❌ None |
| WebSockets | ❌ None |

**This application is fully air-gap capable.** It requires zero network access to function. Firewall rules blocking all traffic for `AIOpsStudio.exe` are safe to apply.

> **Firewall / NGFW Note:** A block-all rule for `AIOpsStudio.exe` is the recommended posture. Any outbound connection attempt from this process should be treated as anomalous and investigated.

---

## 6. Privilege & UAC Requirements

| Phase | Privilege Level Required |
|---|---|
| **Installation** | Standard user (user-profile install) *or* Local Admin (Program Files install) |
| **Runtime / Normal Use** | **Standard User** — No elevation required, no UAC prompts |
| **Uninstallation** | Matches install privilege level |

The application **never calls `ShellExecute` with `runas`**, does not request a UAC manifest elevation token, and does not interact with any privileged system API at runtime. It is designed to run safely in a locked-down standard user context.

---

## 7. Persistence Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Present |
|---|---|
| Windows Service | ❌ Not installed |
| Scheduled Task | ❌ Not created |
| Startup Registry Key (`Run` / `RunOnce`) | ❌ Not set |
| Browser Extension | ❌ Not applicable |
| COM Object Registration | ❌ None |
| Kernel Driver | ❌ None |
| WMI Subscription | ❌ None |

**Nothing persists across reboots except the user's data files** (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\AIOpsStudio\`). The application runs only when explicitly launched by the user. It has **no mechanism to start itself automatically.**

---

## 8. Registry Footprint

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\{GUID}_is1` | Standard Inno Setup uninstall entry (written at install time, removed at uninstall) |
| `HKCU\SOFTWARE\...` | None written by the application |

No application-specific registry keys are created at runtime. The only registry entry is the standard Windows "Add/Remove Programs" uninstall record created by the Inno Setup installer.

---

## 9. Dependencies & Supply Chain

All third-party libraries are compiled into the executable at build time. There is no runtime `pip install` or package resolution. The dependency set is:

| Package | Version | Purpose | Network Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PyQt6** | 6.6.1 | GUI framework (Qt6 bindings) | None |
| **PyQt6-Qt6** | 6.6.1 | Qt6 runtime libraries | None |
| **PyQt6-sip** | 13.6.0 | Python/C++ bridge for Qt | None |
| **reportlab** | 4.0.9 | PDF generation | None |
| **pandas** | 2.2.0 | Excel export, data analysis | None |
| **openpyxl** | 3.1.2 | Excel file writing | None |
| **pyarrow** | ≥14.0.0 | Pandas parquet backend | None |
| **matplotlib** | ≥3.8.2 | Chart rendering for reports | None |
| **SQLite3** | (stdlib) | Embedded database engine | None |

> **Supply Chain Note:** At build time, packages are sourced from PyPI. MSP/build teams should verify package hashes against `requirements.txt` using `pip install --require-hashes` as part of the CI/CD pipeline. No packages communicate with external services at runtime.

---

## 10. Data Classification

| Data Type | Stored | Sensitivity |
|---|---|---|
| Food pantry inventory items (name, category, quantity, cost) | ✅ Yes | **Low — Internal operational data** |
| Financial cost data (purchase prices, COGS calculations) | ✅ Yes | **Low-Medium — Internal financial records** |
| Transaction history (intake, distribution, void records) | ✅ Yes | **Low — Internal audit trail** |
| Personally Identifiable Information (PII) | ❌ No | Not applicable |
| Protected Health Information (PHI) | ❌ No | Not applicable |
| Payment Card Data (PCI) | ❌ No | Not applicable |
| Credentials / Passwords | ❌ No | Not applicable |
| Active Directory / LDAP data | ❌ No | Not applicable |

The application has **no authentication layer** — it is intended for single-workstation use by trusted staff in a physically secured environment. If multi-user access control is required, enforce access at the OS level via standard Windows user account management.

---

## 11. Logging & Auditability

### Application Log
- **Path:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AIOpsStudio\logs\aiopsstudio.log`
- **Rotation:** 10 MB per file, 5 backups retained (50 MB maximum)
- **Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - <module> - <LEVEL> - <file>:<line> - <message>`
- **Content:** Application startup/shutdown events, database initialization, transaction records, errors

### Crash Log
- **Path:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AIOpsStudio\crash_log.txt`
- **Written:** Only on unhandled exception (overwrites previous crash log)
- **Content:** Full Python stack trace with timestamp

> **SIEM / Log Forwarding Note:** If log ingestion is required, configure your log agent to monitor `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AIOpsStudio\logs\aiopsstudio.log`. The format is plaintext and parseable by standard syslog agents (Splunk UF, NXLog, Elastic Agent, etc.).

---

## 12. MSP Group Policy Recommendations

### AppLocker / Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)

```
Rule Type:    Path Rule  
Path:         %PROGRAMFILES%\AIOpsStudio\AIOpsStudio.exe  
Action:       Allow  
User/Group:   Applicable end-user security group  
```

Alternatively, use a **Publisher Rule** (more robust — survives path changes):
```
Publisher:    AI Ops Studio LLC  
Product:      AI OPS Studio  
File:         AIOpsStudio.exe  
Min Version:  0.1.0  
```

### Windows Defender Antivirus Exclusions (if scan performance is a concern)

The SQLite WAL files are written frequently during normal operation and may generate excessive AV scan events:

```
Exclude Path:  %LOCALAPPDATA%\AIOpsStudio\inventory.db
Exclude Path:  %LOCALAPPDATA%\AIOpsStudio\inventory.db-wal
Exclude Path:  %LOCALAPPDATA%\AIOpsStudio\inventory.db-shm
Exclude Path:  %LOCALAPPDATA%\AIOpsStudio\training.db
Exclude Process: %PROGRAMFILES%\AIOpsStudio\AIOpsStudio.exe
```

> **Security Note:** Exclude paths are scoped to `%LOCALAPPDATA%` (per-user). No system-wide exclusions are required.

### Firewall

```
Rule Name:    Block AIOpsStudio Outbound (recommended)
Direction:    Outbound
Action:       Block
Program:      %PROGRAMFILES%\AIOpsStudio\AIOpsStudio.exe
Protocol:     Any
```

The application functions normally with all outbound traffic blocked. Any network activity from this process is unexpected and should be flagged.

### Software Inventory / RMM

Register the following for asset tracking:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Display Name | `AI OPS Studio` |
| Registry Key | `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\` (search for `AI OPS Studio`) |
| Executable Hash | *(Generate SHA-256 hash of `AIOpsStudio.exe` from the signed build artifact)* |
| Expected Version | `0.1.0-beta` |
| Expected Publisher | `AI Ops Studio LLC` |

## 13. Uninstall & Data Removal

The Inno Setup uninstaller performs the following:

1. Removes all files from `%ProgramFiles%\AIOpsStudio\`
2. Removes Start Menu shortcuts
3. Removes the uninstall registry key
4. **Prompts the user** whether to delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AIOpsStudio\` (databases, logs, reports, backups)
   - If **Yes**: all user data is permanently deleted
   - If **No**: user data is preserved (useful for reinstall scenarios)

> **Offboarding Note:** For complete removal in an MSP-managed environment, run the uninstaller silently and then issue a `rd /s /q "%LOCALAPPDATA%\AIOpsStudio"` command via your RMM tool to ensure all user data is removed, since the silent uninstaller skips the data-deletion prompt.

**Silent uninstall command:**
```cmd
"%ProgramFiles%\AIOpsStudio\unins000.exe" /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART
```

## 14. Known Limitations & Security Considerations

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| **No application-level authentication** | Access is controlled by Windows login. Recommend OS-level user account restrictions. |
| **No database encryption** | SQLite databases are stored as plaintext. If data-at-rest encryption is required, enable BitLocker on the workstation. |
| **No multi-user / role-based access** | Single-user design. All operators share full access to the local database. |
| **No audit log signing** | Log files are plaintext and can be modified by the local user. For tamper-evident logging, forward logs to a centralized SIEM. |
| **Beta software** | Version 0.1.0-beta — production use should be validated against organizational change management policy. |
